## üß† Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experiments from the research paper:

**ZK-CIL-NIDS: A Zero-Knowledge Class-Incremental Approach for Network Intrusion Detection**

The goal of this research is to investigate and evaluate a the best novelty detection strategy for **network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)** without requiring prior knowledge of unseen attack classes ‚Äî a setting we call **Zero-Knowledge Class-Incremental Learning (ZK-CIL)**.

We aim to assess how novelty detection methods can be incrementally applied to evolving threat landscapes, where new types of attacks appear over time, using real-world intrusion datasets.

## üìä Algorithms Compared

The following novelty and outlier detection algorithms are evaluated:

- `Random` (baseline)
- `OneClassForestwoBootstrap`
- `OneClassForest`
- `IsolationForest`
- `NeuronalNetworkLoss`
- `NeuronalNetwork`
- `OneClassSVN`
- `EnergyFlowClassifier`
- `DistanceLOF`
- `LocalOutlierFactor`

These models are tested under class-incremental scenarios to assess their ability to generalize across newly introduced attack classes.

## üóÇ Dataset and Splits

Experiments are based on various incremental configurations of training and testing data, simulating real-world deployment where attacks emerge over time. We split the data as follows:

### Day-Based Datasets

| Dataset Name | Train Set | Test Set |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| TrainDay0_TestDay1234 | BENIGN | BENIGN, FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator, DoS, Heartbleed, Web, Infiltration, Botnet, Portscan, DDoS |
| TrainDay01_TestDay234 | BENIGN, FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator | BENIGN, DoS, Heartbleed, Web, Infiltration, Botnet, Portscan, DDoS |
| TrainDay012_TestDay34 | BENIGN, FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator, DoS, Heartbleed | BENIGN, Web, Infiltration, Botnet, Portscan, DDoS |
| TrainDay0123_TestDay4 | BENIGN, FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator, DoS, Heartbleed, Web, Infiltration | BENIGN, Botnet, Portscan, DDoS |

### Attack-Specific Datasets

| Dataset Name | Train Set | Test Set |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| TrainDay0_DDoS | BENIGN | BENIGN, DDoS |
| TrainDay0_DoS | BENIGN | BENIGN, DoS |
| TrainDay0_FTPPatator | BENIGN | BENIGN, FTP-Patator |
| TrainDay0_Heartbleed | BENIGN | BENIGN, Heartbleed |
| TrainDay0_Infiltration | BENIGN | BENIGN, Infiltration |
| TrainDay0_SSHPatator | BENIGN | BENIGN, SSH-Patator |
| TrainDay0_Web | BENIGN | BENIGN, Web |
